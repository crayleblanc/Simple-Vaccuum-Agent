# Simple Vaccuum Agent
Dependencies: Numpy, Math<br/>
The program is the implementation of a simple agent that detects and vacuums the nearest dirt spots in a graph matrix. The agent is represented by the letter "A" and "1" is the spot of dirt.<br/><br/>
Running the program will print out the current graph, the cost function, as well as the most recent action of the agent. Feel free to change the positions of the agent and the spots of dirt.
